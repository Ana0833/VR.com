			For as long as humans have been around, we've always tried to capture our  experience and memories. Back when we hunted and gathered, we painted them on cave walls. When we invented the camera, we took stilted black and white photos.<br>
			

			As technology has advanced, we've adapted. More compact cameras allowed us to bother our neighbors with vacation slideshows. Camcorders made home videos possible. Smartphones and the internet have opened the door for a whole range of personal videos, from Snapchat stories to vlogs on YouTube.<br>

			Now there's VR and 360 video, which is slowly starting becoming a mainstream thing. You can find both on two of the most popular platforms on Earth, YouTube and Facebook. At the same time, both technologies are new, and we're still figuring out just how to best capture our beloved memories.<br>

			We record our experience and memories so that we can attempt to remember them in the future; so we can get close to re-living them. This human need to capture and attempt to relive our memories will no doubt transfer over to VR. But how?
